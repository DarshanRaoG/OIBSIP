  # 2. Number Guessing Game - GUI based Game
  * A short Java Project that allows the user to guess the number generated by the computer.
  * I have used MVC (Model - View - Controller)
  * User is prompted to enter a number in a displayed dialogue box.
  * Then it is displayed whether the number matches with the generated one or it is greater/lesser than it.
  * The game continues until the user guesses correctly or the number of guesses left are zero.
  * There are many difficulty levels like Amateur(10000 guesses), or expert(20 guesses) etc.
  * User can also choose how many rounds they want to keep playing (1,3 or 5).
  * Score is displayed which gets updated based on this formula:<br>
    ``` score = (100 - (Num of guesses made * 10)) * Multiplier - Hint Penalty ```
  * Multiplier is based on the difficulty selected (1x to 5x).
  * Each hint used doubles the penalty, so score can become negative too!
