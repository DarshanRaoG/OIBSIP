# OIBSIP
  # 1. ATM Interface - Console based Application (OIBSIP_TaskNo3)
  * Initially the user is asked for user ID and Pin, for either creating a new account or using an existing one.
  * Then he/she can do any of these operations:
    * Check transaction history
    * Withdraw
    * Deposit
    * Transfer
    * Check balance
    * Quit
  
  #
  # 2. Number Guessing Game - GUI based Game (OIBSIP_TaskNo2)
  * A short Java Project that allows the user to guess the number generated by the computer.
  * I have used MVC (Model - View - Controller)
  * User is prompted to enter a number in a displayed dialogue box.
  * Then it is displayed whether the number matches with the generated one or it is greater/lesser than it.
  * The game continues until the user guesses correctly or the number of guesses left are zero.
  * There are many difficulty levels like Amateur(10000 guesses), or expert(20 guesses) etc.
  * User can also choose how many rounds they want to keep playing (1,3 or 5).
  * Score is displayed which gets updated based on this formula:<br>
    ``` score = (100 - (Num of guesses made * 10)) * Multiplier - Hint Penalty ```
  * Multiplier is based on the difficulty selected (1x to 5x).
  * Each hint used doubles the penalty, so score can become negative too!

  #
  # 3. Online Examination (OIBSIP_TaskNo4)
  * This application allows the user to do the following:
    * Login
    * Update Profile and Password
    * Give the exam by selecting MCQs
    * Submit (or auto-submission due to Timer)
    * Quit or Logout
