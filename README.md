  # 1. Number Guessing Game
  * A short Java Project that allows the user to guess the number generated by the computer.
  * User is prompted to enter a number in a displayed dialogue box.
  * Then it is displayed whether the number matches with the generated one or it is greater/lesser than it.
  * The game continues until the user guesses correctly or the number of guesses left are zero.
  * There are many difficulty levels like Amateur(Unlimited guesses), or expert(20 guesses) etc.
  * User can also choose how many rounds they want to keep playing (1,3 or 5).
  * Score is displayed which gets updated based on how close to the number the user guesses. If its off by one, points awarded are 50, otherwise 25 etc.
